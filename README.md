NOTE:

1. I have used messagebird as my OTP provider

2. I have used Node.js as my backend language.

3. Create an account in messagebird to get the API_KEY and paste it in index.js line 10. I have tested the api by using my API_KEY. OTP can be sent only to registered messagebird mobile number in the free plan. To send messages to other numbers we have to pay.

4. I also created frontend for the API using handlebars.

HOW TO RUN:

1. Run "npm install" from the root of the folder to install the dependencies I have used.

2. Run "npm start" only after pasting the API_KEY in index.js.

3. Open localhost:3000 on your web browser.
